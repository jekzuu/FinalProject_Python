I.	PROJECTOVERVIEW

	  The purpose of the system I have implemented is to expedite the healing process while
 improving the quality of care provided to patients in my facility, which is called "RapidCare."
 I created this system with the aim of delivering faster and more effective solutions to
 improve my patients’ conditions in a timely manner. The idea for this approach was inspired
 by my observations at another clinic, where I noticed that patients were required to 
 complete a significant amount of paperwork before they could even enter the treatment room. 
 This process not only delayed the start of their care but also added unnecessary stress to
 an already challenging experience. In contrast, my system completely eliminates this step,
 enabling the medical team to immediately focus on addressing the patient’s health concerns.
 This change ensures that treatment begins without delay, resulting in a more streamlined,
 efficient, and patient-centered approach to care delivery.

II. Explanation of how Python concepts, libraries, etc. were applied

import tkinter: Used for creating and developing a user-friendly interface. It supports
designing forms with components like text fields, buttons, dropdown menus, and more.

import mysql.connector: Ensures the secure handling of data input into the system and
other database operations.

import messagebox: A module for displaying warning messages or alerts, particularly when
the user inputs invalid data into the system.

import subprocess: Enables Python to execute external commands, scripts, or processes directly.

from hashlib import sha256: Provides tools to securely hash and encrypt passwords
for enhanced security.

import json: Facilitates the storage and retrieval of data in a structured format.

import datetime: Designed to manage and manipulate dates and times effectively.

import sys: Offers functions and tools for interacting with the Python runtime
environment and the underlying system

III. Details of the chosen SDG and its integration into the project

The "RapidCare" system plays a crucial role in advancing key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
particularly SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).
By offering affordable healthcare services, "RapidCare" eases the financial burden of medical expenses,
helping to alleviate poverty and ensuring that essential care is accessible to those in need, directly 
supporting SDG 1. Additionally, "RapidCare" contributes to SDG 3 by providing high-quality healthcare 
services that improve overall health systems, reduce diseases, and promote the well-being of individuals
and communities. Its focus on comprehensive care addresses both immediate health needs and long-term 
wellness. Aligned with SDG 6, the "RapidCare" facility prioritizes cleanliness and sanitation, ensuring
that food, water, and medical equipment are properly sanitized. This commitment to hygiene safeguards
patient health and minimizes the risk of infections. Through these efforts, "RapidCare" is not only
transforming healthcare delivery but also fostering a more equitable and healthier future for communities worldwide.

IV. Instructions for running the program
I.Login Form
To access the system, you must first enter a username and password. In this example, only the admin username
and the password "1234" are accepted, but other usernames and passwords can be configured as needed. Logging
in is required to navigate to the next page. Once you're done using the system, you must log out or exit to
ensure proper security and functionality.

II.Application Form (Patient)
In the second image, you can see an application designed for entering patient information. Staff members can
input the patient's details into the system, and once all the information is filled out, they can finalize the
process by clicking the "Done" button.

III.Application Form (Guardian)
The third image displays the parent's details, where a RapidCare worker has entered the necessary
information. After completing all the required fields, the data can be submitted.

IV.Confirmation Button
The fourth image shows a confirmation button. This feature is included in almost all of
my buttons to ensure that proceeding is intentional and to allow users to double-check the information they have entered.

V.Table of Information
The fifth image displays a comprehensive table containing all patient details, including records of check-ups, emergencies,
and other information entered through the application form. The interface also features buttons for various actions such as
"Add," "Update," "Delete," "Print," and an "Exit" option to close the system when necessary.

VI.Add / Update Button
In the sixth image, clicking "Add" on the table opens the application form automatically. After entering the patient
details, clicking "Done" takes you to the guardian details section. Once all the information is completed, the new entry
is added to the table. Similarly, the "Update" button works like the "Add" button. When clicked, it opens an application
form where you can modify the patient and guardian details. After completing the updates and clicking "Done," the table
reflects the updated information, showing only the changes made.

VII.Delete Button
The "Delete" button enables you to remove a patient's information, including the guardian's details. To delete,
simply select the patient's entry and click the "Delete" button to proceed. Guardian information can also be deleted 
in the same way.

VIII.Print Button
The "Print" button generates a receipt with the patient's information when clicked. However, it does not display
payment details, as it is intended only for recording catch-up payments.
